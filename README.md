# Bike Lane Demand Estimation Model (Project Under Development)

This is a project that tries to analyze various conditions of a road and tries to recommend the need of a bike lane based on the features of the input road.

The major factors being considered are -

1. The bike accidents happened at a particular spot on the road along with the several features of the crash, and 
2. The existence of several businesses along the road, which might mostly need a bike lane.

#### Datasets being used for roads 

1. [North Carolina Bicycle Crash Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/north-carolina-bicycle-crash-data)
2. [Yelp Dataset for Businesses](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)
